											<h2>Personal Information</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My name is Angeles Iturriaga, everyone calls me Angels, I was born in Chile, moved to Switzerland when I was 10 and later to Australia when I was 16. I speak Spanish, and have been learning English since I can remember making it my second language even if sometimes I feel like I speak it better than Spanish. Moving to Switzerland was a cultural challenge, I had to learn French, but thanks to the immersion I can now say that I am fluent in 3 languages. While I was living in Switzerland I tried to go for my 4th language and went to a boarding school in the German-speaking side of the country. I did not expect the many different dialects that the German language has, and ended up learning Swiss-German. </p>
										<p>I can say that I am a person who has many passions such as technology, its evolution and how it has affected the human experience, also anthropology, psychology and art. My dream has always been to become a professional in the IT field and analyse its impacts and effects on us humans. It is a field that has taken over many aspects of our lives. I think the evolution of information technology has affected all of us and I love being a part of it. I have always wanted to see where the degree combined with my passions would lead me to, so this assignment has definitely been a challenge for me. I believe University is an investment of your money and time and I plan on making the best out of my experience. I see it as a place to improve and gain skills, as well as a challenging place to grow internally.  </p>

										<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I have always had a big interest for computers, technology and video games. My father likes gaming and growing up with him I would always be curious about the way video games were made more than the games themselves. I would watch him play for hours and I would just look at the animations while telling myself that someday I will understand the back end of video games. It wasn’t until I was 13 years old that I was directly exposed to coding and gained more appreciation towards developers. </p>
									<p>Tumblr was at its peak and I spent a lot of time on the app. I made it my safe space where I could share my photography, art and even other people’s posts that resonated with me and looked good together, it was all about the aesthetic. I realised the people that got the most followers were the ones that had made a custom feed instead of using a template. That is how I discovered html. I remember looking at hundreds of Youtube videos and having a very hard time understanding what even was html. I spent hours trying to enhance the looks of my page. I got very frustrated but persisted and eventually got it working and that helped me gain over 1000 followers. </p>
									<p>I decided to study at RMIT because online studies accommodate me at this moment of my life. I have a basic knowledge of IT and programming and the inclusiveness of the bachelors degree gave me an opportunity to acquire the skills I want for my future. I have decided to study IT because after a few years working as a graphic designer I decided that I want to upgrade my skills. After some time I came to the conclusion that UX design was a great path to follow. I would also love to work as a creative director in animation at some point. I think a degree in IT and the creativity of each are great assets to achieve this. I truly believe this can open many doors for me and my future. During my time in University I intend to learn the the necessary skills to become a UX designer. I enjoy studying, observing and learning and I am certain that when I finish I will have the skills to gain decent employment and therefore to contribute to improvement and growth of the field.  </p>

										<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The role of a UX/UI designer is hard to define but basically consists on the creative/aesthetic side of the development of the user interface, making a product accessible and appealing for us humans. In this case of their new game’s user interface. One of the main purposes of this position would be to design and create the game's tutorial, to make the game accessible to new players. I would also work alongside the main UI designer to ensure that the players do not encounter any issues during their playtime.</p>
									<p>I consider myself a creative mind who has always had a fascination for how video games are created. This job would fulfil many of my childhood dreams, but it would also allow me to gain experience as a UX designer. The challenge of creating the game's tutorial would certainly help me work my creative side while putting to use my IT skills. This is something I have always wanted to achieve and working side by side with the main UI designer of the video game would be an incredible learning experience.</p>

									<p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </p>
									<p>Even though they don’t ask for any specific qualifications, the skills needed for this position are few but quite specific. These include experience working with: </p>
									<p>   • Unreal Engine. Although it is used by professionals in many different areas, Unreal Engine is a game development engine that was created by Epic Games. The skills required to work with unreal engine to design a video game are: C++, blueprints, basic knowledge of data structures, sound spatiality, a logical mind, and the basic knowledge of physics, geometry and mathematics, all of these are skills are needed to design in 3 dimensions in order to give the player a multidimensional experience.  </p>
									<p>   • Scripting. Using scripting languages will allow you to create more specific gameplay options, program movement of different characters or objects, and create sequences, or random events that allow players more options of ways to interact with your game. Scripting can be either visual or text based. As for visual scripting they talk about Blueprint. Blueprint can be defined as a high-level visual scripting language done within Unreal Engine. It encourages the use of visuals, connecting graphics with a drag and drop method rather than text. On the other hand text based scripting is the use of any text based scripting language, in this case Python, Lua or C# to create your design.</p>
									<p>In the application it is stated that experience working as a UX designer on a different commercial game, and having a background in UX theory or HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) might be useful for the role. </p>
									<p>In regards of the soft skills, they are looking for someone kind, curious, with great communication skills and a positive professional attitude. For this role you must constantly be in contact with different teams such as engineering, art and production. </p>
									<p>I count with all of the soft skills and very few of the technical skills. My knowledge of Python and C++ are basic at the moment. I also have some experience with visual scripting due to my Graphic Design experience. I understand the data structures that are necessary to perform well at the job, but have no experience working with them. I think by the end of my degree I will feel comfortable enough to use Python as a scripting language. I plan on minoring in web design. Even if this minor includes some UX design subjects, I intend to take a course to specialise in order to get comfortable, gain confidence, and to perfect my skillset. I will challenge myself to learn how to use Unreal Engine in my free time as well as learning the necessary scripting languages to master it. </p>

											<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
										</header>
										<p>In regards to my personality, my results of the Myers-Briggs test indicate that I am a ENFJ-A (Extraversion, Intuition, Feeling, Judgment - Assertive). They refer to this type of personality as a Protagonist-Assertive. We are born leaders, called to serve a greater purpose in life, we are altruists and have a passion to help people achieve their full potential. We tend to speak up for what we believe is right, so we can often be offended when people have different principles. Sometimes we can sound over idealistc and condenscending, that is due to our authenticity and sense of our values. Protagonists tend to reveal how ordinary situations can be handled with compassion, dedication, and care, even the smallest activities are an opportunity for us to lead our way to a brighter future, so in team work we tend to motivate people to do better while keeping a positive attitude but not being pushy. </p>
										<p>In respect to my learning style, the results I got are tactile/kinesthetics. This means we learn the best when we are using our sense of touch or moving while studying. Tactile learners tend to absorb more information while doing things rather than when listening or reading. While working I often find myself in a trial and error stage for a while until it makes sense to me.</p>
										<p>The third test I took was a psychometric personality test. These test results show your main characteristics and are given on a basis of 10 (1-3 being unsuitable, 4-7 being suitable, 8-10 being very suitable). My first characteristic is confidence (8/10) in my own ability to succeed showing my capacity, intelligence, and drive to achieve my goals in a work environment and have a successful outcome. In teamwork this could affect me whenever people would want to direct me in a different direction. But I am aware that criticism and external encouragement is necessary for growth and progress. The second characteristic is achievement drive (7/10) this shows the extent to which my inner drive and ambition help me achieve excellence and carry out my goals. </p>
										<p>What I can draw from all these results is that I would best fit a role as a leader, eventhough I don't like leading. This would give me the chance of encouraging people to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve their goals while supporting them and making them see things positively, not forgetting to strive towards the end goal.</p>

										<h2>Project Idea</h2>
									</header>
									<p>My project idea consists on an exchange based ‘social-media’ platform for teaching and learning technical abilities, this could be online or in person, where people ‘pay’ for lessons with a currency that is based on how much time you have spent teaching someone something. Basically you earn points by teaching, and you spend points learning a new skill. Let’s say I know how to draw and I am looking to learn Russian, but the Russian teacher I found does not want to learn how to draw I can pay for the lesson with points, that I have earned teaching someone how to draw, and she might use them to take singing classes with a different app user. In this app time is money. </p>
									<p>With the outburst of Covid-19 people have had a lot of time in their hands, working from home can become boring and many have been looking to learn new skills to entertain themselves. I have spoken to Grandmas that want to learn how to use computers, teenagers looking to learn how to crochet, plumbers that would love to learn how to cook and the list goes on. Often people have a lot of motivation to learn a new skill but lack of means to pay for a class. This would make it fair for everyone that has a skill who is looking to learn a different one.</p>
									<p>This platform would be a mobile app, a website would also be available for laptop users, making it accessible for more people. It would work by location, the user would have the ability to expand their radar, change their geolocation, even go international if the skill they are looking to learn is not available close to them, or in the case they are travelling and would like to organise their time in advance.
									When you first sign up to the platform you will be asked what skills you can teach and what skills you would like learn, but you won’t have any points yet and therefore you will not be able to take any lessons at this stage. However it will automatically put you as top priority as a teacher, for the people looking to learn your skill, to give you a chance to gain points quickly. If another new user is looking to learn the skills you teach and you are looking to learn the skills they teach it will match you to one another automatically.
									<p>In the case you only want to learn a new skill, the use of credit and debit cards to purchase the currency will be allowed.</p>
									<p>This app will have two sections, one would be for on site learning and another one for online learning. This is to make it inclusive and more accessible for users and avoid putting people at risk. With the global pandemic it has become hard for some people to leave their homes, as the exposure to the virus can significantly damage their health. Some are more comfortable learning by doing with the help of the ‘teacher’ (which would be the case of some sports). In the case of on site lessons, for security reasons we will ask the new users to provide a valid photo of ID/passport. This is to avoid any uncomfortable situations in the user experience. If the user feels unsafe at any time, they will have an option to contact emergency services from the app itself, this feature will track any movements from both the users phones.</p>
									<p>The length of the lessons can vary as well as the price. These will be organised by the app users via an integrated chat and will be added to a calendar. The app will send a push notification and email to the user a few hours before the set time (they will have the choice of the time frame). If you fail to show up on time you will get a penalty, in case of the teacher it will give the learner a free extra lesson, or the equivalent in points, in case of the learner it will take it as if he attended the lesson. As for the online sessions, the video calls will take place through the app itself, that way it is easy to monitor in case there is any issue.</p>
									<p>To build the mobile app, Kotlin is needed for Android phones. As for iOS, I would use Swift, the language most used by iOS developers. For the front end of the website I would use HTML, CSS & react, and for the back end Python-Django & Apache. I would use AWS (Amazon Web Service) as the host, and Oracle, as the DBMS (database management system). As for the chat, I would use an open source messaging framework. I have found one called Chat-SDK which is a fully featured open source instant message framework. </p>
									<p>The skills required to design an app would be to know the programming languages listed above and some experience working with them, back-end and front-end development, user interface design, cybersecurity, cross-platform development skills, product management and business skills, object oriented programming. </p>
									<p>If this app was successfully launched, I truly believe it would help people around the world in many different ways. Expanding their skill set would be the main characteristic, but connecting with more individuals with their same interests is also very important to some of us. People have been distancing themselves from one another due to the worlds’  pandemic. Financial issues have also affected the world and it is one of the main reason holding people back from learning something new, specially during these hard times. This project was designed to give people the possibility to study, learn, practice a sport, to teach, instruct, and simply to connect with others. </p>
